<h1 class="title">Using sticky modifier keys</h1>
<p>
<b>Update</b> I ended up not liking this as much as I thought, mainly because there
is no way to undo accidental key presses. I could see myself keep using
sticky modifiers if there was a way to define a timeout.
</p>

<p>
My workflow is pretty much a 100% keyboard driven, between Emacs and my
Window Manager I use a lot of modifier keys. While having a keyboard like the
Kinesis Advantage helps a great deal in reducing the gymnastics your fingers
have to perform I decided to try and optimize my workflow further using
sticky modifier keys and I'm very happy with the result.
</p>

<p>
If you already have a keyboard with easily accessible modifiers, making them
sticky is like having motions in Emacs similar to vim, except all your
motions start with a modifier on your thumb cluster. It takes some getting
used to but I definitely think it's worth a try if you are an Emacs user.
</p>

<p>
Depending on your system there are multiple ways to achieve this. For
GNU/Linux systems running Xorg there is a tool called <a href="https://github.com/stephenmontgomerysmith/xkbset">xkbset</a> which allows you
to set various features of XKB (X keyboard extension).
</p>

<p>
Here's how to enable sticky modifiers using <code>xkbset</code>.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">xkbset sticky -twokey -latchlock
xkbset exp 1 =sticky
</pre>
</div>

<p>
By default pressing two keys at the same time disables sticky keys, we want to disable this
using <code>-twokey</code>.
</p>

<p>
Pressing a modifier twice locks it, for example, pressing shift twice would basically act as caps lock.
This could be nice but I decided to disable it using <code>-latchlock</code> argument.
</p>

<p>
Finally <code>xkbset exp 1 =sticky</code> makes it so the sticky keys don't expire.
</p>

<p>
I feel like this in combination with my custom repeat keymaps using the built-in
<a href="https://karthinks.com/software/it-bears-repeating/">repeat-mode</a> has greatly improved my Emacs experience.
